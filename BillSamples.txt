Yes the sync function seems to be a little off. 
Good morning Soros. Have you been able to ask Bruce about whether he likes apple watch? 
Thanks again for being my spy lol. 
It will take a a few hours to be full. 
Burgers. Sorry no pics lol. 
They are gorgeous!
We found out that they’re called bleeding hearts. 
Don’t know. We have to look it up unless Jim knows like Bill knows. 
Not too bad but busy enough. 
We are here. Everything is so beautiful.
I’m charging the car then off to Arnold arboretum 😊. 
You can tell them that although you’re not catholic, you want to confess about the cookies lol. 
Good intentions are enough. When does it start?
I prefer mine with nuts lol. 
It’s a beautiful day for it too! Your cookies are so yummy!
I hope you get a great turn out (and people are vaccinated!).
Wow, that’s exciting!
Let's buy it! one one may favorite houses lol. 
Such delicate color palette. 
The word was on my mind. 
When you do it, I will tell you how I thought of it.
just a lucky guess! Truly. 
I can related to many of these things lol. 
Wow, a triple olive cheer!
Congrats!
So happy for you!
And sour cream with chives?
Yes it’s getting pretty warm out there. 
My car is on dog mode while I shop. 
Is this the last test?
Good luck on your test today!
Good morning Soros. Sleeping for a long time is good 😊!  
What problem did you solve?
Yes, won’t let go of him.  
He should.  
I’m gonna plan something for us to get away for a few days.
Haha, no, just didn’t get to the computer until now. 
Bruce is doing OK. 
He still has a cough and sore throat but is getting better. 
I’m bringing him some lunch and dinner today.
Good morning Jim and Bill. 
Yes, I’ve been up since 7am. 
Already out with Tucker and went to the store for a few things. 
Gonna be in the 80’s today!
Yahoo!
Bruce, how are the dumplings? 
Your aunt’s dumplings are always SO GOOD!
I’m marinating chicken legs to eventually go into the air frier. 30 more minutes to go! and making a fried rice to go with it.
I love hot dinner rolls!!!
Such a delicious summer salad!!!
Very yummy!!! This is from your aunt right?
Good luck. You got this!
Tucker found a ball in the park. He’s very proud of himself but he’s also very tired because we were running around playing catch up. 
I might take you up on it. Should have yesterday!
Yes, that’s a good idea. I’ll do it once we’re back in Waban.
Good to be working! I have to modify my schedule to do a little more work!
You should make up some more boxes of more flowers and things!
Bruce is back deck makes a great place for flowers. 
Your gardens are BEAUTIFUL!!!
Good morning Jim and Bill. 
Tucker and I are good. 
Just waking up. 
Tucker had breakfast and went back to bed lol. 
I’m having coffee and enjoying the new little garden out the window. 
Thank you! 
You are all amazing people!
If I do my job right, we will have home grown eggplant that we love!
I remembered to pinch the flowers off the basil after I looked at the photo lol. 
I planted the leeks in a bucket lol. 
Who knows whether they will grow. 
Thanks. 
I’m pretty happy with it! 
Always cheers me up to plant a little garden. 
He is happy. 
We’re at the park and he’s always happy here. 
Tucker agrees don’t look for it. 
No don’t look for it.
I’m glad you put that in context. 
Cockroaches are disgusting. 
Must be pretty big 🤔 lol. 
Thanks, that would be great! 
 My garden is not big enough to grow egg plant or big peppers though. 
I will stop by unless I go to Waban tonight 😊. 
Slow day for me. 
I’ll hit the gym, take Tucker to the park, then maybe off to a garden center to buy plants for my patio garden.
That’s sad. 
Just let him know that you’re thinking about him. 
That’s what matters. 
We’re good. 
I’m still in North Reading as Bruce has been dealing with a bad cold. 
Which reminds me that I should schedule a day with you to come to the yard. 
Good morning Bill. 
How you doing today?
Hi Jim. 
How’s your day shaping up?
Good morning everyone. 
Happy hump day!
Yesterday, I was at the park and a person was using an auto ball machine at the tennis court. 
Tucker was lunging after every ball that was fired out lol. 
He’s a multi-talented and proud representative of his canine community. 
Tucker can’t seem to make up his mind. 
Football star, skateboard champion, horticulturalist. 
Decisions decisions!
It must be a huge relief to be free of pain so quickly!
I hope the cortisone gives you some relief Bill!
Beautiful sunny day today.
Good morning Jim. 
How are you doing?
I think Bruce’s mom is a very good cook!
Sorry, my photos need more explanation haha. 
They always send me the food photos. 
Our texts get pretty convoluted at times lol. 
It must be so difficult to be confined!
Food that Bruce’s mom made. 
Bruce’s parents are doing well so far. 
They have plenty to eat etc. 
Yeah, it hurts his ears until I put in on the terrace. 
Yes, he doesn’t understand what the sound is or why he is being assaulted by it. 
I hope they come to the house to inspect before they set off the alarms so we can drive away before it takes place!
Yeah, it hurts his ears until I put in on the terrace. 
The fire department is doing their annual inspection so I’m at my place today. 
They also set off the alarms which scares the crap out of Tucker and me. 
I hope you all are having a good Monday so far.
Hello Monday morning!
OMG, so yummy looking!
That’s amazing!
Mulan was pretty good so I’m hoping yours was too. 
I was talking about the Manhattan lol. 
Gotta say that beats dumplings. 
Hope so!
What you getting for takeout. 
Leftover seafood from lunch and also from Mulan Restaurant. 
Miss you guys too ❤️. 
We ended up at Ipswich clam bake. 
Other line was too long.  
Waiting for a fisherman’s platter. 
On our way to the clam box in Ipswich for lunch 😀. 
You can pick it out, one dollar each. 
But the main revenue is the entrance fee $12 per person.
We are done. It’s too cold out. 
Good morning all!
Yes, that is incredibly sad!  
Yes, make it DIRTY baby!
Yes, nothing like an icy cold martini!
A beautiful thing!
Yeah, that’s likely it. 
They probably brought in lots of part timers that were told to push everything for moms.
Which one did you go to?
What a wealth of knowledge!
Shaken not stirred 😊. 
Love, love, love blue cheese stuffed mammoth olives!
We are now going to Quincy Chinese supermarket. 
Gettin ready for a little afternoon delight.
Waking up and workin up an appetite. 
Morning. What you guys doing today?
Yes windy too. 
Feels like it’s gonna rain. 
Oh busy weekend for you. 
We’re doing fine here. 
I’m out with Tucker right now and it’s a little chilly out here.
Good morning everyone. Happy weekend!
He would dispatch it very quickly. 
Do you think that the lilacs will still be good next weekend?
Thinking about taking my aunt. 
Costco. 
Happy Friday. 
Love the mint and the heat!
So good!
Beautiful. 
Thanks Coach. 
Just kidding. 
I’m still on the elliptical. 
I checked out the side that Arnold Arboretum and couldn’t find a live stream. 
Please send me the link. 
We got invited to one of Bruce’s friends house for lunch on Saturday. 
We have no other plans yet though. 
The weather should be nice.
Good morning guys. 
We were at the public garden on Sunday and it was already beautiful. 
It should be spectacular by now!
Excellent! 
Having clean windows is so nice!
How did the window cleaning go?
Have a good day Jim 😊. 
Great job on wordle. 
I struck out 5 times. 
Doing well this morning. 
Looks like another cloudy day today. 
Good for the gardens!
Busy day today? 
Sweet dreams!
He’s a mad man.
We need to get Superman to get it spinning the right way again.
Well, many officials already have their heads up their asses! 
Does that count?
I think that with people are tired of being cautious and want to go out. 
It was obvious yesterday in Boston too. 
The public gardens were filled with people, most without a mask.
We are all good. 
I watered the garden today and bought Bruce and I some bon me for lunch that we had on his back porch. 
We’re back home now and taking precautions but Bruce is most likely not contagious now based on CDC guidance. 
We will wait until Thursday to touch again. 
Thanks 😊. 
Ordered!
Safe travels!
Which is better?
Nice. 
Glad you guys are in the garden. 
How are you guys doing? 
A millennial old fashioned lol.
