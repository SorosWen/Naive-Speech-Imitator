Yes Bill took very good care of me.
Bill, you delivered a lot of food to me! 
Iâ€™m feeling blessed!
It was very mild. 
I took a couple of days off and relaxed in bed. 
Yeah, itâ€™s milder than a regular cold. 
Do you mean nudes. 
Send pics! 
Many varieties ðŸ˜ƒ. 
There is no eclipse yet. 
You have to ask yourself from a year ago. 
Yummy. 
We can build one in the backyard!
Whatâ€™s blooming there?
Iâ€™m feeling the same. 
Haha I saw his videos too. 
Dumplings were good! 
Chives and eggs inside. 
Thank you boys. 
It will take a few weeks to grow. 
A lot of times they wonâ€™t grow for some reasons. 
Thanks! 
And the one that is good for trimming the front bushes. 
Just the long saw that cut the branches and bushes. 
Iâ€™m happy to buy you guys lunch. 
Itâ€™s a new place that I discovered in Newton has good food.
Iâ€™m gonna borrow Jimâ€™s tool to trim my bushes and branches. 
You guys want to come for dim-sum tomorrow noon, my treat. 
Maybe you can help me with some garden in the afternoon?
We will get a new Tesla replacement while our car is being fixed. 
Good, you? 
Bring nothing. 
We can drive you here. 
Yes it looks good. 
Sorry just saw it. 
I think so. 
They only met once I think. 
But I have known him for a loooong time. 
He is a very nice and trust worthy person, better than someone else who we wonâ€™t name his name.
I wonâ€™t hook you up with him.
Just to do the grill together. 
Yes I met him once. 
He is a very smart IT person. 
He used to own a company then retired. 
This Saturday noon. 
Iâ€™m thinking to do a grill with our friend. 
You are welcome to join. 
If you are lonely, welcome to our place to have fun this weekend. 
When he will be back home? 
Bill is going to speak with our friend to see if he can rent his place to us. 
But you can also see what is available in Provincetown and we can share the cost. 
This is the hottest photo of the day.
